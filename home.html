    <p id="p1">  Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny is fond of a phrase, “the wonderful Russia of the future,” his shorthand for a country without President Vladimir Putin.

        But in the year that has passed since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has gone back to a dark, repressive past.
        
        Over the last 12 months, Putin’s government has crushed the remnants of Russia’s civil society and presided over his country’s first military mobilization since World War II. Political opponents such as Navalny are in prison or out of the country. And Putin has made it clear that he seeks to reassert Russia as an empire in which Ukraine has no place as an independent state. </p>

    <p id="p2"> As the anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine approaches, a Russian warship armed with one of Moscow’s most powerful weapons pulled into a port on South Africa’s east coast this weekend.

        The frigate Admiral Gorshkov – carrying hypersonic Zircon missiles, according to President Putin – has a “Z” and “V” crudely painted in white on its blackened smokestack, just like the Russian tanks and artillery pieces that rolled into Ukraine a year ago.
        
        It is participating in a 10-day naval exercise in the Indian Ocean alongside South African and Chinese warships. </p>

    <p id="p4"> An aquarium employee waves a mackerel near a penguin – but there’s no reaction. When she moves the fish closer to its beak, the penguin turns away haughtily. An otter sniffs the fish, then runs away.

        For the penguins and otters at Japan’s Hakone-en Aquarium, an hour’s drive southwest of Tokyo, inflation and rising prices have meant a change in diet – and the animals are not happy about it.
        
        Before, the aquarium offered penguins and otters “aji,” or Japanese horse mackerel, which the animals readily ate. </p>
